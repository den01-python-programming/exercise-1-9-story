# Exercise 1.8 - Converstion

Write a program that works as follows:

```plaintext
Greetings! How are you doing?
*Good thank you!*
Oh, how interesting. Tell me more!
*Well, there's really nothing to tell.*
Thanks for sharing!
```

```plaintext
Greetings! How are you doing?
*Nice and dandy like cotton candy!*
Oh, how interesting. Tell me more!
*Just went shopping.*
Thanks for sharing!
```

The exercise template comes with a program template that includes the function and its call.

```python
def conversation():
    # Write your code here
    
conversation()
```
